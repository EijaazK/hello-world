# hello-world
My first repository
I am Eijaaz Karim and am striving to become and aeronautical engineer. I wish to study at Imperial College London and get a Meng degree. After attending a lecture about software engineering on 25/3/18, I realised that learning coding is a vital skill. Hence why I am here.
